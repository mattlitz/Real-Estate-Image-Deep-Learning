# Real-Estate-Image-Deep-Learning
Class project for DS 6050 Deep Learning - Image Recognition and Classification on Real Estate Images

’A good picture is worth a thousand words’ and a good picture does help in selling a house. Posting pictures is a necessary part of advertising a home for sale. Agents typically sort through dozens of images from which to pick
the most complimentary ones. This is a manual effort involving annotating images accompanied by descriptions (bedroom, bathroom, attic, etc.). When volumes are small, manual annotation is not a problem, but there is a point
where this becomes too burdensome and ultimately infeasible. Here, we propose an approach based on computer vision methodology to radically increase the efficiency of such tasks. We present a high-confidence image classification
framework, whose inputs are images and outputs are labels. The core of the classification algorithm involves use of the Convolution Neural Network (CNN), and fully connected neural networks, along with a substantial preprocessing for
image enhancement. Our project for Deep Learning is based on the computer vision with the goal of image classification and recognition. We are provided with the images of the rooms of houses and these images are taken from different
angles. We will use these images to recognize them and classify them into images of living room, bedroom, kitchen, front yard, back yard, etc. We need to create a robust model that can handle such classification.
